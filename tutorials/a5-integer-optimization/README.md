# A.5 - Model Optimization with Discrete (Integer) Variables

In this tutorial we show how to optimize a function with discrete input parameters,
 along with continuous ones.


## Problem Setup

We want to minimize the following function:

$$ f(x_1, ... x_{10}) = \sum_{i=1}^{10} 10^{6*i/10} * x_i^2 $$ ,
where $x_1, x_2, x_4, x_7 \in \mathbb{Z}$, $x_3, x_5, x_6, x_9, x_{10} \in \mathbb{R}$.

We do not set constraints in this problem. <!-- Maybe as soon as CCMAES is
implemented, we could add constraints? Not sure but this seems to be the point
of CCMAES, in comparison to CMAES. -->


##  The Objective Function
We create a folder `model`, and inside a file `model.py`, where we define the
function that we want to optimize:

```python
def model(d):
  npar = 10
  res = 0.0
  v = d["Parameters"]

  for i in range(npar):
    if( i == 0 or i == 1 or i == 3 or i == 6):
        res += pow( 10, 6.0*i/npar) * round(v[i]) * round(v[i])
    else:
        res += pow( 10, 6.0*i/npar) * v[i] * v[i]

  d["Evaluation"] = -res;
```

Then, in another file, for example `run-cmaes.py`, we start by importing the
function we just defined (assuming `model.py` is in subfolder `model` relative
  to the current file), and creating an `Experiment` which we will configure,

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('model')
from model import *

import korali
e = korali.Experiment()
```

###  The Problem Type
We choose *direct evaluation* as problem type, set the objective function to
our previously defined `model()`, and choose maximization as objective,
```python
e["Problem"]["Type"] = "Evaluation/Direct/Basic"
e["Problem"]["Objective"] = "Maximize"
e["Problem"]["Objective Function"] = model
```

###  The Variables
We define 10 variables, of which four ($x_1, x_2, x_4, x_7$) are discrete. Also,
we limit their domain to [-19, 21] each.
```python
for i in range(10) :
  e["Variables"][i]["Name"] = "X" + str(i)
  e["Variables"][i]["Initial Mean"] = 1.0
  e["Variables"][i]["Lower Bound"]  = -19.0
  e["Variables"][i]["Upper Bound"]  = +21.0

# We set some of them as discrete.
e["Variables"][0]["Granularity"] = 1.0
e["Variables"][1]["Granularity"] = 1.0
e["Variables"][3]["Granularity"] = 1.0
e["Variables"][6]["Granularity"] = 1.0
```

###  The Solver
We choose the solver `CMA-ES` and set two termination criteria,
```python
e["Solver"]["Type"] = "Optimizer/CMAES"
e["Solver"]["Population Size"] = 8
e["Solver"]["Termination Criteria"]["Min Value Difference Threshold"] = 1e-9
e["Solver"]["Termination Criteria"]["Max Generations"] = 5000
```

### Output configuration

```python
e["Results"]["Frequency"] = 50
e["Console"]["Frequency"] = 50
```

###  The Korali Engine Object
We create a Korali engine, and tell it to run the experiment we defined,

```python
k = korali.Engine()
k.run(e)
```


###  Running

We are now ready to run our example:

```bash
./a5-constrained-optimization
```

Or, alternatively:

```bash
python3 ./a5-constrained-optimization
```

The results are saved in the folder `_korali_result/`.

###  Plotting

You can see the results of CMA-ES by running the command,
```sh
python3 -m korali.plotter
```


## Optimization with CCMA-ES

Explain [CCMA-ES](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3324989.3325725)?   
This might not be implemented yet. To see whether it is implemented by now, you
can check for "Optimizer/CCMAES" or similar in the source file
[module.cpp](../../source/module.cpp).
