Composite Execution (Running Korali as Model)
==============================================

This tutorial demonstrates that Korali can be composed: models evaluations can contain in themselves a new Korali experiment. 

In this example, the main experiment describes an optimization over the parameter X. Each evaluation will optimize over the parameter Y to find the value of Y which maximizes X*Y.
