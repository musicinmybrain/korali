# A.8 - Hierarchical Bayesian Inference

In this tutorial we show how to do hierarchical Bayesian inference.


## Problem Setup

##  The Objective Function

## Optimization / Sampling  with TODO

###  The Korali Object

###  The Problem Type

###  The Variables

###  The Solver
We choose the solver ..

###  Running

We are now ready to run our example:

```bash
./
```

Or, alternatively:

```bash
python3 ./
```

The results are saved in the folder `_korali_result/`.

###  Plotting

You can see the results by running the command
```bash
python3 -m korali.plotter
```
