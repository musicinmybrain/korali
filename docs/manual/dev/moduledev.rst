Module Development
********************

In this document, we explain the steps to create a new Korali module.

Module Creation Tool
==========================

As first step, use Korali's :ref:`module creation tool <mdev-tool>` to create a new solver or problem with the name of your choice.

Configuration File
==========================

For each module, there is a configuration file with extension :code:`.config` that describes many aspects of the module. We explain below the purpose of each of the category contained therein.

Configuration Settings
-------------------------

Each of the entries in this category represents a user-configurable aspect of the module. Upon building Korali, they become fields in the module's C++ class (see :ref:`Build Process <build-process>`).

Variables Configuration
--------------------------------------

Each of the entries in this category represents a parameter of the Korali experiment's variables. These settings are user-configurable, and they are accessed by prefixing ["Variables"][numerical_index]. Upon building Korali, they become fields in the korali::Variable class file (see :ref:`Build Process <build-process>`).

Internal Settings
--------------------------------------

Each of the entries in this category represents a developer-only aspect of the module. These settings are not user-configurable, but their purpose is to automatize the serialization/deserialization of the internal state of the module. Upon building Korali, they become fields in the module's C++ class file (see :ref:`Build Process <build-process>`).

Module Defaults
--------------------------------------

Defines the default configuration of all the parameters that describe the module. They are overwritten by any user-specified values.

Variable Defaults
--------------------------------------

Defines the default configuration for parameters of the korali::Variable class. They are applied to all the variables defined in the experiment. They are overwritten by any user-specified values.  

(Solvers Only) Termination Criteria
--------------------------------------

Each of the entries in this category determines a criterion that Korali checks at each generation to determine whether to continue or finish execution. These settings are user-configurable, but they are accessed by prefixing ["Solver"]["Termination Criteria"]. Upon building Korali, they become fields in the module's C++ class (see :ref:`Build Process <build-process>`) with prefix _terminationCriteria.

(Problems Only) Compatible Solvers
--------------------------------------

List of all the solvers that can be used with the current problem type. Solvers are specified by name and must produce at least one result.  

(Problems Only)  Results
--------------------------------------

List of all the results that can be obtained by running this problem. Each result specifies which solvers can produce them. It is the task of the developer to make sure that the promised results are indeed produced by the solvers here specified.

(Problems Only) Available Operations
--------------------------------------

Lists all the operations that the problem can perform on a sample. Each operation links to an actual C++ method in the class.
