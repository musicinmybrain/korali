{\bfseries Korali} is a high-\/performance computing framework for optimization, sampling and Bayesian uncertainty quantification of large-\/scale computational models.

\subsection*{What Korali does for you}

\subsubsection*{\href{/tutorials/optimization/optimization}{\tt Optimization}}

Given any function \begin{DoxyParagraph}{f\-:}
mathbb\{R\}$^\wedge$\-N\{R\}
\end{DoxyParagraph}
Korali can find its minima or maxima\-: \$$^\wedge$ = \{\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \}\{\} \textbackslash{},\textbackslash{},\textbackslash{}, f() \textbackslash{},,\$\end{DoxyItemize}
\subsubsection*{\href{/tutorials/sampling/sampling}{\tt Sampling}}

Treat \$f\$ as an unnormalized density and draw samples to determine its distribution\-: \$$^\wedge$\{(k)\}  f.\$

\subsubsection*{\href{/tutorials/bayesian/bayesian}{\tt Bayesian Inference}}

Given a set of data \$d\$, the output of a computational model \$f(x;)\$, a likelihood function \$p(d$|$)\$, and a prior probability density \$p()\$ Korali will build the posterior distribution\-: \$\$ p( $|$ d) \textbackslash{}, = \textbackslash{}, \{p(d $|$ ) \textbackslash{},\textbackslash{}, p()\}\{p(d)\}\textbackslash{}, \$\$

Allowing users to compute the maximum a posteriori estimate\-: \$$^\wedge$ = \{\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \}\{\} \textbackslash{},\textbackslash{},\textbackslash{}, p( $|$ d) \textbackslash{},,\$ or sample its posterior distribution\-: \$$^\wedge$\{(k)\}  p( $|$ d).\$\end{DoxyItemize}
\subsection*{Design Principles}

\subsubsection*{\href{usage/basics}{\tt Extensibility}}

Korali is designed as a completely modular and extensible software. Operations can be changed on runtime to produce multiple results without the need of re-\/compilation.

\subsubsection*{\href{usage/basics}{\tt Multi-\/\-Language}}

Korali applications can be programmed in either C++ or Python. Additionally, Korali can sample from C++/\-Python and pre-\/compiled computational models.

\subsubsection*{\href{usage/config/#evaluation-conduit}{\tt Multi-\/\-Intrusiveness}}

A novelty in Korali is its support for multi-\/intrusive evaluation. That is, Korali can sample from computational models either semi-\/instrusively, through static linking or dynamic loading of Python modules; or nonintrusively, through shell command execution.

\subsubsection*{\href{tutorials/mpi/mpi.md}{\tt High-\/\-Throughput}}

Korali's work distribution engine has been optimized to fully harness computational resources, maximizing throughput and minimizing latency and load imbalance.

\subsubsection*{\href{tutorials/mpi/mpi.md}{\tt High-\/\-Performance}}

Korali supports the execution of parallel (Open\-M\-P, Pthreads), distributed (M\-P\-I, U\-P\-C++), and G\-P\-U-\/based (C\-U\-D\-A) models.
