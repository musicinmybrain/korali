{\bfseries Korali} is a high-\/performance computing framework for optimization, sampling and Bayesian uncertainty quantification of large-\/scale computational models.

\subsection*{What Korali does for you}

\subsubsection*{$\ast$$\ast$\-Optimization$\ast$$\ast$}

Given any function \begin{DoxyParagraph}{f\-:}
mathbb\{R\}$^\wedge$\-N\{R\}
\end{DoxyParagraph}
Korali can find its minima or maxima\-: \$$^\wedge$ = \{\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \}\{\} \textbackslash{},\textbackslash{},\textbackslash{}, f() \textbackslash{},,\$\end{DoxyItemize}
\subsubsection*{$\ast$$\ast$\-Sampling$\ast$$\ast$}

Treat \$f\$ as an unnormalized density and draw samples to determine its distribution\-: \$$^\wedge$\{(k)\}  f.\$

\subsubsection*{$\ast$$\ast$\-Bayesian Inference$\ast$$\ast$}

Given a set of data \$d\$, the output of a computational model \$f(x;)\$, a likelihood function \$p(d$|$)\$, and a prior probability density \$p()\$ Korali will build the posterior distribution\-: \$\$ p( $|$ d) \textbackslash{}, = \textbackslash{}, \{p(d $|$ ) \textbackslash{},\textbackslash{}, p()\}\{p(d)\}\textbackslash{}, \$\$

Allowing users to compute the maximum a posteriori estimate\-: \$$^\wedge$ = \{\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \}\{\} \textbackslash{},\textbackslash{},\textbackslash{}, p( $|$ d) \textbackslash{},,\$ or sample its posterior distribution\-: \$$^\wedge$\{(k)\}  p( $|$ d).\$\end{DoxyItemize}
\subsection*{Design Principles}

\subsubsection*{$\ast$$\ast$\-Extensibility$\ast$$\ast$}

Korali is designed as a completely modular and extensible software. Operations can be changed on runtime to produce multiple results without the need of re-\/compilation.

\subsubsection*{$\ast$$\ast$\-Multi-\/\-Language$\ast$$\ast$}

Korali applications can be programmed in either C++ or Python. Additionally, Korali can sample from C++/\-Python and pre-\/compiled computational models.

\subsubsection*{$\ast$$\ast$\-Multi-\/\-Intrusiveness$\ast$$\ast$}

A novelty in Korali is its support for multi-\/intrusive evaluation. That is, Korali can sample from computational models either semi-\/instrusively, through static linking or dynamic loading of Python modules; or nonintrusively, through shell command execution.

\subsubsection*{$\ast$$\ast$\-High-\/\-Throughput$\ast$$\ast$}

Korali's work distribution engine has been optimized to fully harness computational resources, maximizing throughput and minimizing latency and load imbalance.

\subsubsection*{$\ast$$\ast$\-High-\/\-Performance$\ast$$\ast$}

Korali supports the execution of parallel (Open\-M\-P, Pthreads), distributed (M\-P\-I, U\-P\-C++), and G\-P\-U-\/based (C\-U\-D\-A) models.
