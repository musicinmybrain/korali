Normal Distribution
*******************************

## Normal
          
The probability density of the Normal distribution is

$${\displaystyle f(x\mid \mu ,\sigma ^{2})={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi \sigma ^{2}}}}e^{-{\frac {(x-\mu )^{2}}{2\sigma ^{2}}}}}$$

Where:

$\mu$  is the mean or expectation of the distribution (and also its median and mode),
$\sigma$  is the standard deviation, and
$\sigma ^{2}$ is the variance.
