CMAES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy)
******************************************************************

This is the implementation of the *Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy*, as published in `Hansen2006 <https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-32494-1_4>`_. In an evolution strategy, new candidate solutions are sampled according to a multivariate normal distribution in :math:`\mathbb {R} ^{n}`. Recombination amounts to selecting a new mean value for the distribution. Mutation amounts to adding a random vector, a perturbation with zero mean. Pairwise dependencies between the variables in the distribution are represented by a covariance matrix. The covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) is a method to update the covariance matrix of this distribution.
CMAES works iteratively, evaluating a number :math:`\lambda` of samples per generation, and improving the covariance matrix for the samples in the next generation.

This solver also implements the *Constrained Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy*, as published in `Arampatzis2019 <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3324989.3325725>`_, a version that includes gradient information `Chen2009 <http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/2009papers/kz/gh4.pdf>`_, a version for mixed-integer optimization `Hansen2011 <https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00629689/document>`_, and a version for purely discrete optimization `Benhamou20019 <https://hal.science/hal-02011531/document>`_.
