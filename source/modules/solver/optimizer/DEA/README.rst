DEA (Differential Evolution Algorithm)
*******************************************************************

This is an implementation of the *Differential Evolution Algorithm* algorithm, as published in `Storn1997 <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008202821328>`_.

DEA optimizes a problem by updating a population of candidate solutions through mutation and recombination. The update rules are simple and the objective function must not be differentiable. Our implementation includes various adaption and updating strategies `Brest2006 <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4016057>`_.
