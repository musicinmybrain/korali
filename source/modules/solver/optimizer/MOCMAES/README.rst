MO-CMA-ES (Mutli-Objective Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy)
****************************************************************************

This is the implementation of the *Mutli-Objective Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy*, as published in `Voss2010 <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1830483.1830573>`_.
The multi-objective covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (MO-CMA-ES) is an evolutionary algorithm for continuous vector-valued optimization. It combines indicator-based selection based on the contributing hypervolume with the efficient strategy parameter adaptation of the elitist covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES).
