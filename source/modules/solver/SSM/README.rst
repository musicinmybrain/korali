Stochastic Simulation Methods (SSM)
***********************************

Stochastic simulation methods solve problem of type :ref:`optimization <module-problem-reaction>`. A reaction consists of reactants (or reservoirs), products and an associated reaction rate. Implementation based on `this project`<https://github.com/amlucas/SSM>`_.
