Uses a combination of a training and evaluation :ref:`Neural Networks <module-neuralnetwork>` to solve a :ref:`Supervised Learning <module-problem-supervisedlearning>` problem. At each generation, it applies one or more optimization steps based on the loss function and the input/solutions received. The input and solutions may change in between generations.
