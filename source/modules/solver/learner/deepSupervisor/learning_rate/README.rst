Learning Rate Functions
*********************************

Implements different functions to be used with :ref:`Supervised Learning <module-problem-supervisedlearning>` to adapt the learning rate after each epoch.

* Constant:
    :math:`\texttt{learning_rate=const}`
* Time Based Decay:
* Step Based Decay:
  Divides the learning rate by a constant factor f every _epoch epochs.
* Exponential Decay:
