Sequential Conduit
*******************************

This sequential conduit is the default conduit when using Korali. It evaluates samples running computational models sequentially (i.e., not concurrently or in parallel), under the same process as the calling application. 

For more information, see :ref:`Parallel Execution <parallel-execution>`.
