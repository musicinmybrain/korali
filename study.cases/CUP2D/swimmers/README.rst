Study Case: Reinforcement Learning for Artificial Swimmers
===========================================================

Environment for artificial swimmers, described by the StefanFish class (see _deps/CUP2D/Obstacles/Stefanfish{.cpp,.h}).

The **state** is given the relative position :math:`\Delta x, \Delta y` to the obstacle, the orientation :math:`\theta`, the phase :math:`\phi`, the speed :math:`u,v` and angular velocity :math:`\omega`, the time of the last action :math:`t_{act}` and previous two baseline curvatures :math:`C_{-1},C_{-2}`, as well as the shear stress at three sensor locations :math:`\tau_1,\tau_2,\tau_3`.

The **action** is given by modifying the baseline curvature :math:`C_0` and the swimming period :math:`T`.

The **reward** is given by the (Froude) swimming efficiency :math:`\eta`.

Settings
--------

The setup is described in the setting.sh file.

Running the code
----------------

In order to configure the run you have to go go to _model/config.hpp and make sure the correct simulation settings and initialPositions vector is uncommented. Furthermore you have to set the correct number of AGENTS in the runscript.

The application is launched locally (or on an interactive node on Piz Daint) using 

.. code-block:: bash

	./run-vracer-swimmer.sh RUNNAME TASK

If you are ready for production you can submitt a job to the batch-system using

.. code-block:: bash

	./sbatch-run-vracer-swimmer.sh RUNNAME TASK

Here you can change the number of parallel agents by changing the NNODES variable.
