System Of Linear ODEs
================================================================================= 

In this study case we compare the sampling of three different sampling algorithms,
namely MCMC (Metropolis-Hastings), TMCMC, and Multi Nest.

For this we first produce synthetic data with the script (1_makeSyntheticData.py).

Last we do Bayesian prediction on the ODE system from the results produced with the Multi Nest algorithm.
