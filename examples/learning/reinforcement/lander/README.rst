Lunar Lander
======================

A problem where a spaceship is to be landed on a surface as quickly as possible, yet with a softest possible contact. An example of the full game can be found here: http://moonlander.seb.ly/

In this case, the only the x,y position is passed as state. As a consequence, a recurrent NN is necessary to infer the velocity of the lander.
