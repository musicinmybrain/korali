# Korali

High-performance framework for uncertainty quantification and optimization.

## Description

Korali is a high-performance framework for uncertainty quantification of large-scale models. Korali's multi-language interface allows the execution of any type of computational model, either sequential or distributed (MPI), C++ or Python, and even pre-compiled/legacy applications. Korali's execution engine enables scalable sampling on large-scale HPC systems. 

Korali provides a simple interface that allows users to easily describe statistical problems and choose the algorithms to solve them, allowing users to apply a wide range of operations on the same problem with minimal re-configuration efforts. Finally, users can easily extend Korali to describe new problems and test new experimental algorithms
