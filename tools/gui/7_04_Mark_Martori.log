Tasks:
- Re-code the relationships between tabs in order to be able to delete them and add new ones in a logical order. Solved.

- Create a dictionary to facilitate passing frames globally. Semi-solved. It may need more options in the future.

- Create a new function: 
	def on_tab_selected(event):
	# Respond to an event and provides the curent selected tab.

- Fix the comunication between the tabs-variables and tabs-experiments in order to have several variables in one unique experiment. Solved.

- Fix deleteTab() function. Solved.
- Fix deleteVariable() function. Solved.


TO FINISH:
- Pass from one tab-variable1 to the next tab-variable2 the same information so we can have several variables with same content for same experiment. Not Solved yet.


TO START:
- Starting with next goal:

Create a .config out of the options selected in an experiment.
The config should look like this:
{{solver},{problem},[{var1},{var2},{var3}]}
